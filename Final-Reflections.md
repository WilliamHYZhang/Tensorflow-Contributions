# Final Reflections

Wow, what a ride this contest was. I'm really happy that I got the chance to compete in Google Code-in with Tensorflow. I've made new friends, learned new things, and got introduced to a great community openly welcoming collaboration.


## Favorite Moments
Here is a small compilation of my most favorite moments from the contest

I really appreciated it when I received an email personally thanking me for contributions on behalf of TFDS from a maintainer of the library. Thank you Mr. Michalski for your nice letter!

Hey William,

I've noticed your contributions to TFDS and I want to thank you personally.

I am especially thankful for your code reviews of other people pull requests.
This makes my job a lot easier :-)

Thanks again,
Marcin

I was so happy when one of my PRs adding a dataset got [merged](https://github.com/tensorflow/datasets/pull/1290)!

I also loved adding the PR [template](https://github.com/tensorflow/datasets/pull/1383) that's now default for TFDS (yay)

Working with [SwiftPlot](https://github.com/KarthikRIyer/swiftplot) during the contest was an absolute blast. Before this, I didn't even know how to code in Swift, and throughout the contest, I've implemented the complete annotation features to the library, fixed bugs, as well as added some tutorials which I'm really proud of.

I really enjoyed working with Android development for the first time, and unleashing my creativity on my [SeeFood](https://github.com/WilliamHYZhang/SeeFood) app based off of Silicon Valley :heart:

Finally, I'm really excited to continue with [S5TF Team](https://github.com/s5tf-team), a new organization that Rick and I created.

## Thank You

I am so very thankful of so many people throughout this competition who helped, contributed, commented, etc. on my work.

I'd like to thank Adrish Dey for his immense help with my first couple of advanced tasks related to adding datasets to TFDS. He was super helpful during the time where I was still getting to know the workings of the TFDS library, and thanks to him I've learned so much about TFDS and was able to spread what he taught me to other GCI competitors through PR reviews.

I'd also like to thank Karthik Iyer and the rest of the SwiftPlot core team (Ricardo and Karl) for their help, support, and guidance with my SwiftPlot tasks. As I said earlier, I went in knowing absolutely nothing about Swift, and thanks to them I was able to contribute my best work to the library.

Thank you to Ayush Agrawal for being extremely helpful with my Swift for TensorFlow tasks and providing last-minute support and task review before the deadline.

Thank you to Yasaswi for reviewing and providing great comments with my notebook tasks, as well as Vasudev, Ashish Kshirsagar, Akshita, Rothith Pudari, Vidushi, Kailash S, Nishant, Stephen Mugisha, DynamicWebPaige, iHrishi, Daksh Miglani, Gaurav Saha, Sayak Paul, Hunar Batra, Vedant Singh, Param Bhavsar and Govind Dixit. I really appreciate all of your volunteering your time to help comment and reivew.

Thank you to all my fellow GCI competitors, it's been a pleasure and special thanks to those who graciously accepted my PR reviews. Special thanks to Rick Wierenga for the support and help with S5TF Team, looking forward to continue working on it.

WZHANG out :v:
