Google Colab notebooks are a great way to share your code with others and comes with built in support for Tensorflow. Here are some cool projects I developed that might interest you while coding with Tensorflow. Enjoy!

- Detecting Lung Cancer with UCI Dataset:

  [Here's](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17lpO1vNKLv1NW2Noiyus4aSFlDYrn-4x) a project that I created that accurately detects lung cancer with the help of the lung cancer UCI [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Lung+Cancer).
 
- Using Optimized BERT Versions with TF 2.0 + `transformers`:

  [Here's](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jGHn0ibHjKnwgvjIogltnPTvJ5pp16kx) a project that I created demonstrating ALBERT, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT models using TF 2.0 + `transformers`.
