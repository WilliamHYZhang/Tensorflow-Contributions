# Tutorials

Google Colab notebooks are a great way to share your code with others and comes with built in support for Tensorflow. Here are some nice tutorials I wrote that might help you when developing with Tensorflow. Enjoy!

- TF 1.x with keras to TF 2.0:

  [Here's](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oHnEZ5w8Y0PFhwRZLx9h1YOautDQEDm-) a tutorial that I updated to support the new TF 2.0 API interface. [original](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/tensorflow/tensorflow_keras.htm)

- Migrating data pipeline to ```tf.data.Dataset```:

  [Here's](https://colab.research.google.com/gist/WilliamHYZhang/1a77408d603703ce5e3eed000dc8b915/classification.ipynb) a tutorial that I updated to support the more efficient use of ```tf.data.Dataset``` for loading data. [original](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/classification)

- Analyzing ```tf.keras``` vs ```tf.estimator```:

  [Here's](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QrIbk12DPl5IDdIL56jYN5LyjRbS3sEw) a tutorial that I wrote to examine training models using ```tf.keras``` compared to using ```tf.estimator```.

- ALBERT with TF Hub:

  [Here's](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10obw7iPySglC2fWjLDVhzDVA_ULFx2S2) a demonstration and code run-through of how to set up and use ALBERT with TF Hub.

- Visualization of activation heatmaps in `tf.keras`:

  [Here's](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PF6tVF0uX8UcMoRfSBauPltSJdxHVFIL) a tutorial on how to overal heat activation maps using `tf.keras` with a way to obtain these images without the need for any more local/GDrive space with some cool cv2 tricks.
