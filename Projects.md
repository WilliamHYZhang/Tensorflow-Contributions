# Projects

Here are some cool projects I developed that might interest you while coding with Tensorflow. Enjoy!

- Detecting Lung Cancer with UCI Dataset:

  [Here's](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17lpO1vNKLv1NW2Noiyus4aSFlDYrn-4x) a project that accurately detects lung cancer with the help of the lung cancer UCI [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Lung+Cancer). In addition, I also added this dataset to TFDS (see my PRs).
 
- Using Optimized BERT Versions with TF 2.0 + `transformers`:

  [Here's](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jGHn0ibHjKnwgvjIogltnPTvJ5pp16kx) a project demonstrating ALBERT, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT models using TF 2.0 + `transformers`.
  
- Image Classification using TF 2.0:

  [Here's](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/195AtRTI6-vn6Vat-55PAd4BHx2sYRDbc) a project exploring transfer learning on the Fashion MNIST [dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist).

- Animated progress bar in `tf.keras`:

  [Here's](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1T9NrB9yDghmPj6ljkrGDzoNXDBPzO_1g) a neat little project coding up a progress bar in `tf.keras`.

- SeeFood:

  [Here's](https://github.com/WilliamHYZhang/SeeFood) a cool Kotlin for Android with TFLite app inspired by HBO's Silicon Valley :heart:

- [Here's](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OQkNbZUXlhBwqNQIRdPHMbr_HPv-f_ocytfu17H0StI/edit?usp=sharing) a really cool project covering image augmentation in Swift and Python. This was also my last GCI task :(
