# Tensorflow-Projects
Collection of tutorials, documentation, code examples, and more for GCI with Tensorflow 2019.

Most of my work with GCI was done on GitHub through PRs, Reviews, Issues, and other direct contributions, but I've also created some interesting projects and tutorials as well, which will be kept in this repository. To reduce plagarism, during the contest period this repository will be private, and I'll make it public when it ends.

Feel free to browse around this repository and look at some cool things to do with Tensorflow. Learn more about Tensorflow [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/learn) and find the documentation [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf). If you have any comments/questions feel free to send me an email or open up an Issue or a Pull Request.
