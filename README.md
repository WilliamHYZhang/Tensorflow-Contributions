# Tensorflow-Projects
Collection of tutorials, documentation, code examples, and more for GCI with Tensorflow 2019.

To reduce plagarism at the request of my mentors, during the contest period this repository will be private, and I'll make it public when it ends.

Feel free to browse around this repository and look at some cool things to do with Tensorflow. Learn more about Tensorflow [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/learn) and find the documentation [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf). If you have any comments/questions feel free to send me an email or open up an Issue or a Pull Request.
