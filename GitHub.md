# GitHub Contributions

By far, my favorite part of Google Code-in with TensorFlow was contributions through GitHub. Below are some of the repositories that I contributed to. Note that not all of these had to do with tasks - a big part of GCI is community involvement :heart:

## Pull Requests
Pull Requests are my most direct contributions to TensorFlow.
- [SwiftPlot](https://github.com/KarthikRIyer/swiftplot/pulls/WilliamHYZhang)
- [TensorFlow Core](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pulls/WilliamHYZhang)
- [TensorFlow Datasets](https://github.com/tensorflow/datasets/pulls/WilliamHYZhang)
- [TensorFlow Examples](https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/pulls/WilliamHYZhang)
- [Swift Jupyter](https://github.com/google/swift-jupyter/pulls/WilliamHYZhang)

## Issues
I also created some issues that I helped find/solve.
- [SwiftPlot](https://github.com/KarthikRIyer/swiftplot/issues/WilliamHYZhang)

## Code Review / Discussion
I really enjoyed helping my fellow GCI peers out whenever I could.
